So I wanted to make heirlooms for wotlk and although they arenot perfect, I think its good enough to share.
The project has been through 3 versions and will scrap the previous 2 versions. Was a fun project and yes mistakes were made.

Goal 1 was not to be crazy o.p. on stats so I have based them on the 178 greens at lv80. 
Added a few more dungeon 1 sets, mage, priest, hunter and deathknight, also a few extra sets depending on spec, 
paladin, shaman now have 2 sets each. Now there is one for every class and 2 for some.

Added only a few more rings, cloaks, trinkets.
The true value of heirlooms I think is in the convineance of leveling with out having to repair.

Goal 2 was to have the availble dungeon blues and purples be stronger then the heirlooms for atleast
most of the pvp brackets. I havnt tested everything yet but hopefully its balanced ok-ish!

Limitations to this set is that there is only 2 armor progressions for each class. So although I would 
like to do more, the game doesn't allow the changes needed with out inta-crashing. There is also armor
progression for cloaks, however I have had to reuse this for shields instead as the protection classes
were unviable. All classes benefit slighly from this change.

I included the spreadsheet I used to track everything. If any one else is interested can easily takeover.
enjoy! :D
