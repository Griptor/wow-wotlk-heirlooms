how to install;

1. start the sql server and connect with heidi
2. select the world db
3. open a query tab and drag and drop the sqls, run it
4. copy the patch to the game client /data/enGB
	or enUS (may need to rename the patch, untested)
								
Please feel free to customise with the attached spreadsheet I used.

enjoy! :D
